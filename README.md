# The Surly Bikes Blog, in a feed

This is a quick and dirty scrape of the [Surly Bikes Blog](https://surlybikes.com/blog) converted to the [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) format.

### Why not the full content of the blog

1) Scaping the first page of the blog was easy. Following all the links and getting the content is actual, y'know, _work_.
2) I haven't asked Surly's permission to do this so I'm not really comfortable scraping their whole blog.

### Why JSON Feed?
It was the easiest to implement. Ruby and JSON are extremely compatible.


## Contributing

If you find a bug, want to add a different feed format, want to add more features, or generally pretty up the code you can clone the project, make your changes, and send a pull request.
